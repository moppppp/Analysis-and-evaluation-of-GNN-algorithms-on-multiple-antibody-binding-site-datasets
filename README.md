Nanobodies are artificial antibodies derived from the immune systems of camelid animals, obtained through artificial processing and isolation of antigen-binding proteins. Their small molecular size and high specificity endow nanobodies with broad potential applications across various fields. However, determining the paratope (antigen-binding region) of nanobodies through experimental methods is both expensive and time-consuming, and traditional computational methods often lack sufficient accuracy. To improve prediction accuracy, we propose NanoKGAT, a method that employs Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and the antibody pre-trained language model AntiBERTy to fully leverage the sequence and three-dimensional structural information of nanobodies.These features capture the complex dependencies between amino acid residues.
